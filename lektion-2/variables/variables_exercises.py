# Variables in Python - Exercises
# ==========================

# 1. Simple variable
# Create a variable 'city' and assign it the name of your hometown. Print the value.

city = 'Stockholm'
print(city)

# 2. Naming rules
# The following variable names are invalid. Explain why and rewrite them so they work.
# 1variable = 100
# my-variable = "hello"
# print = "hej"


# 3. Case sensitivity
# What will be the output of the code below, and why?
# Age = 25
# age = 30
# print(Age)
# print(age)


# 4. Dynamic typing
# Create a variable x and assign it an integer value.
# Then change x to a string value. Print both values.


# 5. Multiple assignments
# Create three variables (a, b, c) in one line
# and assign them the values 10, 20, and "Thirty". Print them.


# 6. Type casting
# Create a variable num_str = "123".
# Convert it to int and float.
# Print both values and their types.


# 7. Object references
# Run the following code and explain the result.
# x = 5
# y = x
# x = 10
# print("x:", x)
# print("y:", y)


# 8. Swapping values
# Swap the values of two variables a and b without using a third variable.


# 9. String length
# Create a variable word with any word.
# Use len() to calculate the number of characters in the word and print the result.


# 10. Scope
# Study the code and explain why the output is what it is.
# x = "global"
#
# def my_func():
#     x = "local"
#     print("In function:", x)
#
# my_func()
# print("Outside function:", x)
